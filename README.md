<h1>NomicCoin</h1>

NomicCoin is a Proof-of-Stake based coin, with voting and a shared pool of funds integrated into the protocal.

Users can create proposals which can:

* Force official client to upgrade
* Spend a shared pool of funds

Proposals can then be voted on by owners of NomicCoin. One coin equals one vote.
If a proposal passes with greater than 50% of the voting public, then the proposal will be run automatically by the network.

The idea comes from the game, Nomic, which is a rule making game, where players are allowed to change the rules of the game while playing it.
