# Frequently Asked Questions

## How can i run the client with `someoption=XXX`?

You can either run the client with this option directly on the command line (`./nomiccoind -someoption=XXX`) or, if you want a more permanent solution, you may put this option in the coin configuration file (which is located inside a folder inside your home directory).

## What is a "RPC request"?

A RPC ("Remote Procedure Call") is a way to perform low-level operations on a running node. You can send RPC requests using either the command line, or the debug window (Qt client only).

## Can i mine Proof-of-Work blocks with the client?

Just don't. If you really must, launch the client with `gen=1`, but really, don't. The embedded miner is extremely inefficient, and should only be used for testing purposes.

Note that this note also includes the Qt client (since the headless client and the Qt client share the same miner source code). In both case, use a third-party miner, such as CPUMiner.

## How can i disable stake generation?

Run the client with `stakegen=0`. Note that you won't mint anything as long as this option is set.

## What does `Estimated time to stake` means?

This time is the time that it would statistically take for your coins to stake with a probability of 90%. Some notes:

  - **This display is purely informative, and does not reflect the actual time you will have to wait.** Because the amount displayed is the statistically time required for the probability to stake becomes greater than 90%, the estimated stake time is *not* a countdown (it will not decrease at every second/minute/...). Indeed, statistically speaking, the fact that you didn't staked yet doesn't increase your chances to stake from now on. The only things that will affect the estimation are the amount of coins currently staking, and the current network difficulty.

  - The estimation only takes into account what is currently available for staking, right now. It means that it won't take into account the coins that haven't matured yet, neither those that haven't yet reached the minimal stake age.

**Remember: you may stake before this estimated time, or after.**

## Why isn't my client minting?

Your client might not be minting for a few reasons:

  - Your wallet is encrypted, and you have to unlock it in order to mint (otherwise the client can't access your coins). In such a case, you just have to unlock it by using the "Unlock Wallet" menu item.

  - You might not hold any available unspend output right now. Remember that in order for an unspend output to be available for staking, some rules apply:

    - If the unspend output comes from a block reward (PoS or PoW), it has to mature before you're able to spend it (it means that you have to wait about 500 blocks)
    - Each unspend output has to be at least 1.6 days old before becoming eligible to staking
    - Each utxo has to contain at least one coin before becoming eligible to staking

  - Or you might have run the client with the `-stakegen=0` option, which prevents the coins from minting.

## How can i allow someone to mint for me without them being able to actually spend my coins?

What you're looking for is called "cold minting". The procedure for this to work is a bit complicated:

  - First, you have to generate an address; we will call it the "minting address".

    ```
    $> ./nomiccoind getnewaddress
    NYhZozScFVduMdnr4e4mFtXUq1cHCTV2hb
    ```

  - You then have to generate an other address; we will call it the "spending address".

    ```
    $> ./nomiccoind getnewaddress
    NZU5HdPdGCFCrp8KUt8kHzcSZEBn52kxBe
    ```

  - Uses the `addcoldmintingaddress` RPC command to merge the minting and spending addresses together (be careful about the order of the two parameters! Otherwise, you could lock yourself out of your coins).

    ```
    $> ./nomiccoind addcoldmintingaddress NYhZozScFVduMdnr4e4mFtXUq1cHCTV2hb NZU5HdPdGCFCrp8KUt8kHzcSZEBn52kxBe
    n5vK9Y281WtKMvm7YT6T9ktfsR6JzVCH9S
    ```

  - You will obtain a new address. Transfer some funds on it as you wish (this adress will still count toward your balance, and you will be able to spend its fund as usual).

    ```
    $> ./nomiccoind sendtoaddress n5vK9Y281WtKMvm7YT6T9ktfsR6JzVCH9S 100
    5c3fe069bdde68b5d1eed7d661a7cde7eb9a2c74fafdf80e41ee99d884caa975
    ```

  - Finally, export the minting address private key using `dumpprivkey`, and send it to whoever you want to be able to mint for you, along with both the minting address and the spending address.

    ```
    $> ./nomiccoind dumpprivkey NYhZozScFVduMdnr4e4mFtXUq1cHCTV2hb
    8kzz5nUifCMZf75HgMJTAdNvZFSyKrnJ9cooVeYBfBezLGvb37nP
    ```

This person will then have to do the following on their side:

  - First, they will import the minting address private key in their wallet, using `importprivkey`.

    ```
    $> ./nomiccoind importprivkey 8kzz5nUifCMZf75HgMJTAdNvZFSyKrnJ9cooVeYBfBezLGvb37nP
    ```

  - Then they will register the coldminting adress, using `addcoldmintingaddress` (the addresses they will pass as parameters have to be in the same order than in the first step, and they will get the same output).

    ```
    $> ./nomiccoind addcoldmintingaddress NYhZozScFVduMdnr4e4mFtXUq1cHCTV2hb NZU5HdPdGCFCrp8KUt8kHzcSZEBn52kxBe
    n5vK9Y281WtKMvm7YT6T9ktfsR6JzVCH9S
    ```

  - That's all! They will now be able to mint your coins, but not to spend them (the coldminting balance will be show in the `mintingonly` field from the `getinfo` RPC call). Should you want to stop (and get your coins back), create raw transactions from the utxo belonging to the coldminting address, and transfer the coins on another address.
